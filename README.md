# Test-a-Perceptual-Phenomenon
DAND_T2: Project based on Stroop Effect 

Analysis of response time between Congruent and Incongruent condition, a dependent test was designed to check for which hypothesis stands. Null Hypothesis is set to reaction time as equal between 2 and alternative as not equal.
Upon analysis, it is demonstrated that we have enough evidence to reject the null and it goes in line with other findings that Incongruent condition will take longer than congruent one.
